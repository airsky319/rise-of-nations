usa.89.d코0=
usa.89.a코0=This will be the start of the US Rocketry Program!

usa.90.t코0=FDR IMPLICATED IN MURDER OF HUEY LONG
usa.90.d코0=A disgruntled FBI Agent has leaked a story to the press implicating the President in the murder of the prominent populist Senator from Louisiana Huey Long. The Roosevelt Administration has denied the accusations in the strongest possible terms, but the accusations have caused significant damage to the support for and credibility of the FDR Administration, particularly in the South.
usa.90.a코0=This is a disaster.

usa.91.t코0=MacArthur Prepares Offensive Against the Rebels
usa.91.d코0=
usa.91.a코0=They will be crushed by the brilliance of our glorious leader.

usa.92.t코0=Southern Grumblings
usa.92.d코0=Though it started with the Southern populists, Earl Long in particular, anti-Roosevelt and anti-New Deal sentiment has spread throughout much of the South. From unions to southern Democratic Senators, FDR's allies are dwindling in number. Surely this is the end of the FDR presidency - he may sit in his office for the next few years, however his political capital has vanished completely.
usa.92.a코0=Could this threaten our Union?

usa.93.t코0=The Formation of the Confederacy
usa.93.d코0=Mutinous southern Democrats have once again severed the ties between the South and the rest of the Union. Embarassingly enough, Vice President Garner has abandoned the administration to join with the rebels. It remains unclear if the Union will be able to unify behind FDR in this time of crisis.
usa.93.a코0=Join the Southern Rebellion.
usa.93.b코0=Remain Loyal to the Union.

usa.94.t코0=Grumblings on Wall Street
usa.94.d코0=It has been well-known that Mr. Roosevelt's progressive policies have rubbed noses the wrong way on Wall Street, but now it has been reported that the FBI have discovered serious plots aimed at removing Roosevelt from power by any means necessary. The Roosevelt administration denies these rumors in the strongest possible terms, but it remains unsettling nonetheless.
usa.94.a코0=This is destabilizing.

usa.95.t코0=General Douglas MacArthur Ousts President Franklin Roosevelt in a Corporate Putsch
usa.95.d코0=In a short, but bloody putsch, General MacArthur has succesfully aunched a military coup de'tat. It is reported that when soldiers were sent to arrest Mr. Roosevelt and his retinue, the arrest turned into a fire-fight, leaving Mr. Roosevelt and the majority of his cabinet dead.
usa.95.a코0=There are no words...

usa.96.t코0=Henry Wallace Starts a New Government in the West
usa.96.d코0=One of President Roosevelt's surviving cabinet members has fled west and established a government in San Francisco, claiming to be the legitimate executive officer of the United States. Describing MacArthur a 'nothing but a corporate toady' on live radio, President(?) Wallace made an impassioned plea over the radio for citizens to urge their representatives to support the last remnants of the United States government, before it collapses to tyranny.
usa.96.a코0=The man is a joke.

usa.97.t코0=Wallace's Government Gains Momentum
usa.97.d코0=To date, the states of California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Idaho have joined with Wallace against the 'tyrannical' and 'unamerican' regime of General MacArthur.
usa.97.a코0=Join him - He is America's last hope.
usa.97.b코0=Wallace will doom this country - we must resist his influence.

usa.99.d코0=It first began as a distant echoing which grew louder and louder until it was a mighty roar. Atleast that is what it was like for millions of normal Americans who find themselves on the frontlines of the 'Second American Civil War'.
usa.99.a코0=Thus begins the Second American Civil War...



usa.100.t코0=The Soviet Union Requests Industrial Cooperation with the United States
usa.100.d코0=The Soviet Union has sent us a formal request to begin industrial cooperation with our country, inwhich our industrialists will assist them with organizing various projects in their country in return for financial compensation.

USA_the_pacific_war코0=Escort Carriers
USA_the_pacific_war_desc코0=The escort carrier (aka ‘baby flattop’) was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used in World War II. Most often built on a commercial ship hull - Casablanca-class escort carriers were built around the hulls of Liberty ships - they were too slow to keep up with the main fleet. However, they were adequate to escort convoys and provide air support to ground forces during amphibious landings. Escort carriers were cheap and could be built quickly, serving as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. Of the 151 aircraft carriers built by the U.S. during World War II, 122 were escort carriers, including 50 Casablanca class carriers and 45 Bogue class carriers.
