#Austria-Hungary
POLITICS_FRANZ_JOSEPH_DESC코0=Franz Joseph looms large in the historical consciousness of posterity. a symbol of the Monarchy who was beyond criticism. Even today, Franz Joseph is regarded as the very epitome of the emperor in the successor states of the Monarchy. His personality developed in unique and difficult circumstances: from his earliest youth it was impressed up on him that he had been chosen as emperor, an office that was to be served with humility. His mental isolation was reinforced by court ceremonial, which elevated his imperial majesty to an almost religious level. Franz Joseph was wholly imbued with the concept of his divine mission as emperor. In December 1848, Franz Joseph's uncle Emperor Ferdinand abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg's plan to end the Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary. Franz Joseph then acceded to the throne. Largely considered to be a reactionary, he spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy–Venetia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Franz Joseph is troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and transformed the Austrian Empire into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He rules peacefully for now, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his son Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the assassination of his wife Empress Elisabeth in 1898. Yet even after all this he is known to many as a person of integrity and decency, Franz Joseph is variously described by people around him as stoic or even unfeeling in his reaction to the numerous political and military defeats he suffered as ruler, which he took as personal setbacks.

In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.

Frederick himself died in June of that year, and Wilhelm II ascended the throne. In March 1890, he dismissed the German Empire's powerful longtime chancellor, Otto von Bismarck.Wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents, but especially with his English mother In an outburst in April 1889. Although in his youth he had been a great admirer of Otto von Bismarck, Wilhelm's characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the 'Iron Chancellor', the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire. The new Emperor opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect Germany's 'place in the sun'. Furthermore, the young Emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign, unlike his grandfather. While the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor, Wilhelm I had been content to leave day-to-day administration to Bismarck. Early conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men. Bismarck believed that Wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated, and he showed scant respect for Wilhelm's policies in the late 1880s.

POLITICS_UMBERTO_I_DESC코0=On the death of his father Vittorio Emanuele II, on 9 January 1878, Umberto succeeded him with the name of Umberto I on the Italian throne and of Umberto IV on the Savoyard one, since his father had established, despite national unity, the continuation of the tradition nominal on the Savoy throne. On the same day he issued a proclamation to the nation stating: 'Your first king is dead; the successor will prove to you that institutions do not die!'. Umberto's reign saw Italy attempt colonial expansion into the Horn of Africa, successfully gaining Eritrea and Somalia despite being defeated by Abyssinia at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. In 1882, he approved the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. He is positively viewed by some for his attitude shown in facing disasters such as the cholera epidemic in Naples in 1884 , personally doing his best to help (therefore he was nicknamed 'Good King'), and for the promulgation of the so-called Zanardelli code , which he made some innovations in the penal code, such as the abolition of the death penalty.

The young King immediately set to work and, just two days after the death of his father, he summoned the Prime Minister Giuseppe Saraccofor for an interview, of which the same left a detailed account: Saracco had just left the mortuary of the deceased King, when Vittorio Emanuele summoned him to his study; without giving him time to utter the usual words of condolence, the new King showed him the cards that were piled up on the table. They were decrees on which his father had not had time to sign, but which according to him did not agree with the Constitution. Saracco replied that the evaluation of constitutionality was not the responsibility of the King, who had to limit himself to signing as he had always done until then. The young King, however, replied, 'Yes, but from now on the King will only sign his own mistakes, not those of others.'

#Russian Empire
POLITICS_NICHOLAS_II_DESC코0=Though Nicholas was heir-apparent to the throne, his father failed to prepare him for his future role as Tsar. He attended meetings of the State Council; however, as his father was only in his forties, it was expected that it would be many years before Nicholas succeeded to the throne. Sergei Witte, Russia's finance minister, saw things differently and suggested to the Tsar that Nicholas be appointed to the Siberian Railway Committee. Alexander III argued that Nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities, to which Witte replied that if Nicholas was not introduced to state affairs, he would never be ready to understand them. Alexander's assumptions that he would live a long life and had years to prepare Nicholas for becoming Tsar proved wrong, as by 1894, Alexander's health was failing. On 26 May 1896, Nicholas's formal coronation as Tsar was held in Uspensky Cathedral located within the Kremlin. Nicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite.
