dnc_eng.16.t코0=London Conference To Partition The US
dnc_eng.16.d코0=Although the Norse had explored and colonized northeastern North America c. 1000 CE, a later and more well known wave of European colonization of the Americas took place in the Americas between about 1500 CE and 1800 CE, during the Age of Exploration. During this period of time, several European empires—primarily Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France—began to explore and claim the natural resources and human capital of the Americas, resulting in the displacement and disestablishment of some Indigenous Nations, and the establishment of several settler-colonial states. Some formerly European settler colonies—including New Mexico, Alaska, the Prairies/northern Great Plains, and the "Northwest Territories" in North America; the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Darién Gap in Central America; and the northwest Amazon, the central Andes, and the Guianas in South America—remain relatively rural, sparsely populated and Indigenous into the 21st century, however several settler-colonial states, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and the United States grew into settler-colonial empires in their own right. Russia began colonizing the Pacific Northwest, starting in the mid-eighteenth century, seeking pelts for the fur trade. Many of the social structures—including religions, political boundaries, and linguae francae—which predominate the western hemisphere in the 21st century are the descendants of the structures which were established during this period.

dnc_eng.17.t코0=Khaki Election
dnc_eng.17.d코0=The 1900 United Kingdom general election was held between 26 September and 24 October 1900, following the dissolution of Parliament on 25 September. Also referred to as the Khaki Election (the first of several elections to bear this sobriquet), it was held at a time when it was widely believed that the Second Boer War had effectively been won (though in fact it was to continue for another two years). The Conservative Party, led by Lord Salisbury with their Liberal Unionist allies, secured a large majority of 134 seats, despite securing only 5.6% more votes than Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberals. This was largely owing to the Conservatives winning 163 seats that were uncontested by others. The Labour Representation Committee, later to become the Labour Party, participated in a general election for the first time. However, it had only been in existence for a few months; as a result, Keir Hardie and Richard Bell were the only LRC Members of Parliament elected in 1900.
dnc_eng.17.a코0=The Conservatives Win!

dnc_eng.18.t코0=General Election of 1906
dnc_eng.18.d코0=The 1906 United Kingdom general election was held from 12 January to 8 February 1906. The Liberals, led by Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, won a landslide majority at the election. The Conservatives led by Arthur Balfour, who had been in government until the month before the election, lost more than half their seats, including party leader Balfour's own seat in Manchester East, leaving the party with its fewest recorded seats ever in history. The election saw a 5.4% swing from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party, the largest-ever seen at the time (however, if only looking at seats contested in both 1900 and 1906, the Conservative vote fell by 11.6%). This has resulted in the 1906 general election being dubbed the "Liberal landslide", and is now ranked alongside the 1931, 1945, 1983, 1997 and 2001 general elections as one of the largest landslide election victories.
dnc_eng.18.a코0=The Liberals Win!

dnc_eng.19.t코0=Partition of India
dnc_eng.19.d코0=The Partition of India was the division of British India into two independent Dominions: India and Pakistan. The two states have since gone through further reorganization: the Dominion of India is today the Republic of India; while the Dominion of Pakistan was composed of what is known today as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and Punjab, based on district-wide non-Muslim or Muslim majorities. The partition also saw the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury.
dnc_eng.19.a코0=OK

dnc_eng.20.t코0=Imperial Conference Held
dnc_eng.20.d코0=The 1902 Colonial Conference followed the conclusion of the Boer War and was held on the occasion of the coronation of Edward VII. As with the previous conference, it was called by Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain who opened it on 30 June 1902. Chamberlain used the occasion to resubmit his earlier proposals made at the 1897 Colonial Conference for an Imperial Council made up of colonial representatives which would act as a quasi-Imperial Parliament and make decisions for the colonies on imperial policy. This proposal, along with Chamberlain's idea for a unified imperial defence scheme, was rejected by most of the colonial prime ministers. While New Zealand proposed that each colony provide a special force for imperial defence in the case of war, Canada and Australia both believed this idea undermined self-government. Chamberlain also proposed an imperial economic union or customs union with free trade within the empire and tariffs against goods from outside of it. The colonies, however, passed a resolution rejecting imperial free trade. A resolution in favour of imperial preference as proposed by Canada was approved and Chamberlain agreed to bring the idea to the British government. However, this plan was not implemented until the British Empire Economic Conference in 1932.

dnc_eng.21.t코0=Invitation To Join Imperial Federation
dnc_eng.21.d코0=The Imperial Federation refers to a series of proposals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a federal union to replace the existing British Empire. No such proposal was ever adopted, but various schemes were popular in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other colonial territories. The project was championed by Unionists such as Joseph Chamberlain as an alternative to William Gladstone's proposals for home rule in Ireland. Many proposals were put forward, but none commanded majority support. The Imperial Federation League, the main advocacy group, split into two factions in 1893, with one group promoting imperial defense and the other encouraging imperial trade. Various proposals were put forward, with most of them calling for a single state with an imperial parliament headquartered in London. The new parliament would deal with internal trade, foreign relations, defense and other issues that affected the entire federation. The new parliament would rule India directly, while the dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa) would have internal self government. Ireland would also have self-government, which was expected to reduce demand for home rule in Ireland.

Concurrent military activities in the Iberian Peninsula against the Moors (the Reconquista) and in northern Europe against pagan Slavic tribes (the Northern Crusades) also became known as crusades. Through the 15th century, other church-sanctioned crusades were fought against heretical Christian sects, against the Byzantine and Ottoman empires, to combat paganism and heresy, and for political reasons. Unsanctioned by the church, Popular Crusades of ordinary citizens were also frequent.

dnc_eng.51.t코0=[From.GetName] Is Forming A Coalition Against Us
dnc_eng.51.d코0=The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The best known of these Crusades are those to the Holy Land in the period between 1095 and 1291 that were intended to recover Jerusalem and its surrounding area from Islamic rule. Concurrent military activities in the Iberian Peninsula against the Moors (the Reconquista) and in northern Europe against pagan Slavic tribes (the Northern Crusades) also became known as crusades. Through the 15th century, other church-sanctioned crusades were fought against heretical Christian sects, against the Byzantine and Ottoman empires, to combat paganism and heresy, and for political reasons. Unsanctioned by the church, Popular Crusades of ordinary citizens were also frequent. Beginning with the First Crusade which resulted in the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, dozens of Crusades were fought, providing a focal point of European history for centuries.

dnc_eng.156.t코0=Egyptian Revolution
dnc_eng.156.d코0=The Egyptian revolution of 1952 or 23 July revolution, began on 23 July 1952, by the Free Officers Movement, a group of army officers led by Mohammed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk. According to Miles Copeland Jr. and Kermit Roosevelt Jr. It was part of Operation Fat Fucker, aimed at changing to political leadership in Egypt to a more progressive pro-american leadership. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment. How will we react to this?

dnc_eng.159.t코0=Australia Constitution Act
dnc_eng.159.d코0=The Australia Act 1986 is the short title of each of a pair of separate but related pieces of legislationone an Act of the Commonwealth (i.e. federal) Parliament of Australia, the other an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In Australia they are referred to, respectively, as the Australia Act 1986 and the Australia Act 1986 (UK). These nearly identical Acts were passed by the two parliaments, because of uncertainty as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament alone had the ultimate authority to do so. They were enacted using legislative powers conferred by enabling Acts passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state. The Acts came into effect simultaneously.

dnc_eng.160.t코0=New Zealand Constitution Act
dnc_eng.160.d코0=The Constitution Act 1986 is an Act of the New Zealand Parliament that forms a major part of the constitution of New Zealand. It lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles of governance, and establishes the powers of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of state. It outlines the roles and duties of the Monarch, the Governor-General, ministers and judges. The Act repealed and replaced the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 and the Statute of Westminster, and removed the ability of the British Parliament to pass laws for New Zealand with the consent of the New Zealand Parliament.

dnc_eng.161.t코0=South Africa Constitution Act
dnc_eng.161.d코0=Republicanism was always a major tenet of Afrikaner nationalism. Even when nationalists controlled the government, however, political realities prevented this goal from being attained prior to the 1960s. On 3 August 1960, the National Party government announced a referendum would be held in October of that year so that voters might weigh in on the question of whether the Union of South Africa should become a republic. The vote was restricted to white South Africans. More than 90% of eligible voters participated in the referendum, and 52.3% of votes were in favour of 'a Republic for the Union.' The Republic of South Africa Constitution Bill was introduced in January 1961. It came into force on 31 May 1961; 31 May was a significant day in South African history, being both the day in 1902 on which the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed, ending the Second Anglo-Boer War, and the day in 1910 on which the Union of South Africa came into being.

The Act was signed into law on 21 December 1948 and came into force on 18 April 1949, Easter Monday, the 33rd anniversary of the beginning of the Easter Rising. The Act ended the remaining statutory role of the British monarchy in relation to the state, by repealing the 1936 External Relations Act, which had vested in George VI and his successors those functions which the Act now transferred to the President.

Under the terms of the agreement, each of the four parties received a 23.75% share of all the crude oil produced by TPC, which was allowed to operate anywhere in the Middle East between the Suez Canal and Iran, with the exception of Kuwait. The aim of the agreement was to formalize the corporate structure of IPC and bind all partners to a "self-denial clause" that prohibited any of its shareholders from independently seeking oil interests in the ex-Ottoman territory. It marked the creation of an oil monopoly, or cartel, of immense influence, spanning a vast territory.

### FOCUSES
uk_george_vi코0=George VI
uk_george_vi_desc코0=George VI now reigns as King of the United Kingdom & her Dominions, Emperor of India and ruler of the British Empire. A passive sort, George VI is predicted to be a safe pair of hands for the nation, quietly and calmly steering the British people through whatever awaits us.
uk_edward_viii코0=Edward VIII
uk_edward_viii_desc코0=Edward VIII now reigns as King of the United Kingdom & her Dominions, Emperor of India and ruler of the British Empire. Outspoken, brash and defiant of tradition, he is expected to guide Britain down a different path to that which has been tread in the past.
uk_edward_german_visit코0=State visit to Germany
uk_edward_german_visit_desc코0=In a move that many see as interfering in the government's foreign policy towards Germany's actions on the continent, the King has taken a one-week visit to Germany, meeting Adolf Hitler and being recieved with a royal welcome.
uk_appeasement_broadcast코0=The Appeasement Broadcast
uk_appeasement_broadcast_desc코0=Further breaking recent tradition with his outspoken behaviour, the King has given an unusually unguarded and personal interview with BBC news, in which he argues, as a soldier of the last war, for peace on the continent at any cost. While infuriating Whitehall, the King's attitude has proven popular on the streets, with many Britons uneager to die for another European War.
uk_splendid_isolation코0=Splendid Isolation
uk_splendid_isolation_desc코0=Under pressure from the increasingly outspoken King and the populace behind him, the government has taken a drastic policy shift, pledging neutrality on continental affairs. Splendid Isolation, it would seem, is back.
uk_troublesome_brother코0=The Troublesome Brother
uk_troublesome_brother_desc코0=Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor, his abortive reign long since over, has continued to prove an issue. Personal relations between the Duke and the King grow more strained, while pro-Nazi feelings are a growing issue with the cooling Anglo-German relations. To keep him out of trouble's way and stimy any potential German intrigue, it is suggested we send him to the Bahamas where he can rule as Governor.
uk_kings_speech코0=The King's Speech
uk_kings_speech_desc코0=Once again, we find ourselves on the other side of the blade from the hun. Hitler's appetite for conquest has reached an unacceptable level, and the civilised nations of Europe are in arms against him and his revanchist Germany. It is time for the whole nation to come behind this war effort, and what better way to rally support than a speech to the Royal subjects from the British Sovereign.
uk_the_rock코0=The Rock
uk_the_rock_desc코0=France has fallen. German bombers circle overhead. Yet still, Britain stands strong. Prime ministers come and go - politicans are like the wind, but Kings are bedrock. Even as bombs batter the East End, the King & the Royal Family remain in Buckingham Palace, facing the bombs along with their subjects - this a war of all of Britain, not just the common man. We shall prevail, come what may.
uk_colonial_policy코0=Maintain Colonial Policy
uk_colonial_policy_desc코0=Britain's strength is derived from our colonial possessions across the world. It is time to start bringing them up to snuff.

uk_newfoundland_ref코0=Newfoundland Referendum
uk_newfoundland_ref_desc코0=The issue of Newfoundland has long been a contention with the Dominion of Canada. It's time to settle this once and for all, by putting the question to the voters.
uk_rhodesia_federation코0=Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
uk_rhodesia_federation_desc코0=The Rhodesias along with nearby Nyasaland are undoubtedly our most successful colony in Subsaharan Africa, and have been operating akin to an independent state for some time now. It's time to grant them official Federation status.
uk_caribbean_federation코0=West Indies Federation
uk_caribbean_federation_desc코0=The West Indies are hardly the most productive corner of the Empire, but the Americas are the continents of liberty, and it is time to extend that blessing to our Afro-Caribbean subjects.
uk_indian_independence코0=Indian Independence
uk_indian_independence_desc코0=India is the jewel of the Empire, and not one easily parted with. But the tide of independence is rising, and it is better to choose the terms of their departure while we still can.
uk_new_britons코0=The New Britons
uk_new_britons_desc코0=Seeking a better life, many immigrants from the newly-independent states in Africa & Asia are coming to the British Isles.

uk_postwar_boom_desc코0=With the major contingents of the Empire dismantled, and Britain at peace, we have entered a period of massive economic prosperity.
uk_stay_course코0=Stay the Course
uk_stay_course_desc코0=Storm clouds gather on the horizon. The river foams with blood. Dark times lie ahead, and for those times we will need strong, stable leadership - these newfangled political experiments have wrought havoc on the continent and beyond, and for our own sakes let us stick to the tried and tested.
uk_new_direction코0=A New Direction
uk_new_direction_desc코0=The old ways have failed us, that much is clear! The Empire wanes, Hitler runs amok in Europe, and Britain's sun is slowly falling. It is time for change.
uk_assassinate_mosley코0=Assassinate Mosley
uk_assassinate_mosley_desc코0=After being personally battered during the Battle of Cable Street, having his ribs broken by antifascist protestors, Mosley is in hospital and in no position to defend himself. In such a state, a convenient 'accident' isn't beyond imagining...
uk_blackshirt_hegemony코0=Blackshirt Street Hegemony
uk_blackshirt_hegemony_desc코0=With the Bolsheviks shown up and given a good thumping at Cable Street, the blackshirts roam free on the streets of London.
uk_defections코0=MP Defections
uk_defections_desc코0=As Hitler learned, gangs of street-thugs aren't enough to win a nation. The respected position of Baronet Mosley allows us to achieve a level of political legitimacy, and increasingly more radical Conservative MPs are crossing the floor to join us.
uk_fascist_colonies코0=Colonial Support
uk_fascist_colonies_desc코0=Thanks to the perspicaciousness and effiacy of our world-empire, the British race has spread across the world - Just like the race it represents, the British Fascist movement shall not be constrained but to this lone island, but spread across the world!
uk_royal_mandate코0=Royal Mandate
uk_royal_mandate_desc코0=The sovereign, Edward VIII, is a not only the popular and revered King-Emperor of the British Empire, but a sympathiser to our cause, sharing many of our views and sees the need to remain out of any conflicts in Europe. A royal mandate for a fascist government would propel us into power near-instantly!
uk_march_london코0=March on London
uk_march_london_desc코0=The time for talk is over. As Hitler & Mussolini have showed us, debate, electoral politics and other organs of the establishment are irrevocably corrupted by degenerate influence, and it is only through action that we will achieve power.
uk_trade_unions코0=Revolutionary Trade Unions
uk_trade_unions_desc코0=The major trade unions are nothing more than puppets of the capitalist state - demanding only as much as their masters approve them to demand. What good is a leashed union? It is time for true labour representation!
uk_reject_parliament코0=Reject Parliamentary Politics
uk_reject_parliament_desc코0=The Westminster system will never accept a legitimate socialist force. With it's constitutional fluidity, and conservative establishment, it will bend the rules as it needs to keep the voice of the people from being heard. There is nothing to be found for us in the halls of Westminster, so we shall break them down. 
uk_rebuild_empire코0=Rebuild the Empire
uk_rebuild_empire_desc코0=Blind to the truth of our revolutioanry vision, the Empire has deserted us. But by hook or by crook, shall have them back.
uk_recapture_africa코0=Recapture Africa

uk_reconquer_india코0=Reconquer India
uk_reconquer_india_desc코0=The Raj was the jewel of the Empire. Without it, we are crippled. But we shall have the subcontinent back.
uk_reclaim_dominions코0=Reclaim the Dominions
uk_reclaim_dominions_desc코0=The settler-colonies, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, were the end point of the British Imperial project. With resources from India & Africa, we could forge new Anglo nations across the globe. They have deserted us, but they will return to the fold soon.
uk_seize_colonies코0=Seize French Colonies
uk_seize_colonies_desc코0=The French metropole has been annihilated under German tank treads - their colonies now lie vulnerable to any preying Imperialist power, and it is in both of our interests for them to be in a safe pair of hands.
uk_seize_congo코0=Sweep into the Congo
uk_seize_congo_desc코0=Tiny Belgium seems all but gone - their small country ground into the dirt under German tank treads - the vast Belgian Congo now lies practically undefended, and it is in both of our interests for it to be in a safe pair of hands.
uk_join_axis코0=Join the Axis
uk_join_axis_desc코0=The base concept of fascism - that alone, we are weak like a twig, but together as a bundle, we are unbreakable - shows our destiny lies in an alliance with the continental fascist powers. Forwards, for youth and Europe!
uk_recognise_manchukuo코0=Recognise Manchukuo
uk_recognise_manchukuo_desc코0=Japan has since the Great War, been considered an enemy and a threat to our interests in the Far East by many in Britain. It is time to pave that unfortunate diplomatic chasm with mutual respect, starting with recognition of their Manchurian ally.
uk_expand_empire코0=Expand the Empire
uk_expand_empire_desc코0=Anything that remains decrepit and static, an Empire, a nation, a race, will inevitably wither and die. Through constant expansion, reinvention and progress, we shall be the first eternal empire.

uk_conquer_afghanistan코0=Fourth Anglo-Afghan War
uk_conquer_afghanistan_desc코0=This pesky little central Asian despotate has wriggled out of our hands one too many times. They shall come under British rule, once and for all.
uk_flip_board코0=Flip the Board
uk_flip_board_desc코0=This petty 'Great Game' has gone on long enough. It is time for us to flip the board, and finally end this affair once and for all.
uk_revolution코0=Worker's Revolution
uk_revolution_desc코0=The time is now! The general strike is in effect, the workers gather on the streets, raising the red flag to demand their rights. The police are no longer enough, and the army deployed on the streets of London have already begun to desert to us in droves. It's time to storm the palaces of the rich - Westminster, Balmoral, Buckingham, raise the red flag high, and proclaim a bold new future. Workers of the world, unite!
uk_split_us코0=Split the States
uk_split_us_desc코0=The United States, that great New World giant, is both our upstard child and the foil to Japan's imperial ambitions. While seemingly unbeatable, we shall fell this titan with a death from a thousand cuts.

uk_wayward_dominion_desc코0=The loss of Ireland was a nadir in British Imperialism. We shall return them to the fold!
uk_china_backdoor코0=China's Back Door
uk_china_backdoor_desc코0=The Chinese, determined as they are, are putting up a tenacious fight against the Japanese. Our own Raj backs up on their back door, so why not lend some aid?
uk_fascist_military코0=National Mobilization Program
uk_fascist_military_desc코0=The British populace have grown fat, lazy, decadent and distant from the realities of war. It is time to remind them!
uk_oil_bund코0=European Oil Bund
uk_oil_bund_desc코0=Oil is a resource any Empire on the move needs in the modern era, and while our sources in the colonies across the sea provide for now, it would be goood to develop an economic relationship with oil-rich Romania, to whom we are already allied.
uk_colonial_expeditions코0=Imperial Reclamation Brigades
uk_colonial_expeditions_desc코0=Our Empire has abandoned us, and the new order at home needs it back. To this end, let us organise special battalions of the British Army with the express purpose of reclaiming our territories across the sea.

uk_revolutionary_redcoats_desc코0=Any newfound revolution needs its loyal revolutionary elite guard to protect and further the ideals of the movement. The 'redcoats' as some of our men have come to be called, shall form the nucleus of a new British Army.
uk_syndicalist_armories코0=Syndicated Armouries
uk_syndicalist_armories_desc코0=We are a movement of the people, and a revolutionary army should be nothing more than a concrete, physical embodiment of the will of the proletariat. Open up the arsenals!

uk_central_committee_desc코0=We have won. The monarch has fled, and those capitalist stooges that haven't gone with them we have captured, awaiting trials for their years of growing fat off the suffering of the workers. Now, it is time to order our new utopia.
uk_tankie_committee코0=Toe the Soviet Line
uk_tankie_committee_desc코0=In the east, the Soviet Union has already established a successful system! Revolutions can easily slide into just what they opposed, and we must be careful to only use what has been tried and tested to uphold the ideas of the movement.
uk_syndicalist_committee코0=Anarcho-Syndicalist Bloc
uk_syndicalist_committee_desc코0=Lenin, Stalin and the murderous despots of the East are just that - their authoritarian dictatorships are nothing more than a reflection of the old Tsardom. We shall not fall into the same trap.
uk_syndicalist_development_1코0=Rural Development
uk_syndicalist_development_1_desc코0=We are a small island, but strong. History has proved that. By efficiently utilising what space we have, we can recoup the loss of the Empire.
uk_syndicalist_development_2코0=Decentralise Factory Construction
uk_syndicalist_development_2_desc코0=Centrally-planned industrial policy, made by bureaucrats far away from the realities of working life, are no way to comandeer a free society. Those who work, decide how, when, and where they work!
uk_syndicalist_development_3코0=Limited-Access Supply Roads
uk_syndicalist_development_3_desc코0=With the industrialisation of our countryside, our infrastrcture's age is showing. New, special-access roads for resource transportation and industrial purposes will help us bridge this gap.
uk_syndicalist_fed코0=The British Federation
uk_syndicalist_fed_desc코0=The 'United Kingdom' is no less a product of Imperialism than the brutal regime in India, borne out of concordats between bourgoisie Kings. It is time to right that wrong.
uk_syndicalist_research코0=Federal University Sponsorships
uk_syndicalist_research_desc코0=We are a nation rich in learning, with some of the world's oldest institutions. But still, knowledge remains locked in it's ivory tower. Giving out scholarships to the more disaffected people of Britain would help expand our productivity massively.
uk_syndicalist_ireland코0=The Third Syndicate
uk_syndicalist_ireland_desc코0=Ireland, long victimised by the British Empire, finally has a chance for a future together with its fellow nations of the isles. Offering them the tantalising prospect of a united Ireland should be enough to bring them into the Federation.
uk_syndicalist_diplomacy코0=Syndicalist Diplomacy
uk_syndicalist_diplomacy_desc코0=What good is a revolution bound by the shores of Britain? It is time to spread our wings, and across the world!
uk_syndicalist_spain코0=Anglo-Spanish Alliance
uk_syndicalist_spain_desc코0=Spain was the blueprint for the British Revolution - our own premier, Orwell, is a veteran of the war in Spain, as are many of our leading officials. They too find themselves alienated from the authoritarian policies of the Soviet Union, and would be at home in our Syndicalist Internationale!
uk_syndicalist_denmark코0=Syndicalism to Denmark
uk_syndicalist_denmark_desc코0=All peoples of the world enslaved under authoritarian rule clamour for freedom. Only Northern Europe however, is within reach. For now. We shall start with Denmark.
uk_syndicalist_norway코0=Norwegian Foothold
uk_syndicalist_norway_desc코0=With Denmark down, Norway will serve as an excellent next target, and a staging ground for an invasion of the crown jewel of Scandinavia - Sweden!
uk_syndicalist_sweden코0=Spread the Revolution to Sweden
uk_syndicalist_sweden_desc코0=It is time to complete our unification of Scandinavia. Onwards, to Stockholm!
uk_syndicalist_germany코0=Strike the heart of Fascism!
uk_syndicalist_germany_desc코0=Germany is the beating heart of fascism, the font of reactionary poison which spreads throughout Europe and the world. We shall raise the red flag in Berlin, and hang the Fuhrer's corpse from the Brandenburg Gate, or die trying!
uk_soviet_tanks코0=Soviet Tank Engineers
uk_soviet_tanks_desc코0=The Russians are second only to the Germans in their military engineering skills when it comes to tanks - we have much to learn from them, and they are willing to teach us.
uk_soviet_research코0=Anglo-Soviet Research Group
uk_soviet_research_desc코0=Britain and Russia are two countries of tremendous knowledge & learning. Putting our research together, we can brighten the future of the human race immeasurably!
uk_aluminium코0=New Extraction Technology
uk_aluminium_desc코0=We are a small nation, but a rich one. We should be using every resource avaliable to us to expand our industry.
uk_scotland_resources코0=Scottish Mining Cooperatives
uk_scotland_resources_desc코0=Worker-run industries are more efficient, equitable and all-around agreeable. We should apply that policy in northern Scotland, where we possess a small number of rare minerals, which we have to harness to their fullest extent.
uk_autarky코0=Rare Resource Independence
uk_autarky_desc코0=Our island does not have everything. But those things, we can synthesise.
uk_comecon코0=COMECON
uk_comecon_desc코0=The socialist nations of the world need to stick together to ensure our economic neccessities and interest are not perverted by the realities of a capitalist world. To that end, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance!
uk_tankie_diplomacy코0=Socialist Diplomacy
uk_tankie_diplomacy_desc코0=Britain has it's own unique interests, which geographic realities ensure we shall always have. It is time to take a new look at the old, with the benefit of a socialist perspective.
uk_third_worldism코0=Third-Worldism
uk_third_worldism_desc코0=The people of South America & Africa are those most affected by imperialism, capitalism in it's final and most poisonous form. To redeem our past crimes, to them we offer solidarity, and to aid in the breaking of their chains!
uk_tankie_ireland코0=Spread the revolution to Ireland
uk_tankie_ireland_desc코0=Capitalist Ireland could easily become a springboard for a counterrevolutionary invasion of Great Britain by the exiled monarchy and what remains of their Empire. We must move before this happens.
uk_tankie_scandinavia코0=Regional Parties in Northern Europe
uk_tankie_scandinavia_desc코0=It is time to disseminate revolutionary sentiment as far as we can - to start, neighbouring Scandinavia!
uk_colonial_liberation코0=Liberate Africa!
uk_colonial_liberation_desc코0=Imperialism is the end point of fascism. Former collaborators in this devilish system of oppression, we shall redeem ourselves by breaking their chains.
uk_halifax코0=Halifax for PM
uk_halifax_desc코0=It is what the country wants; it is what the party wants; it might not be what Halifax wants, but when your nation calls upon you to serve it, how can you refuse? Halifax wishes to avoid war, and seeks a negotiated peace.
uk_churchill코0=Churchill for PM
uk_churchill_desc코0=Halifax may be what the country wants, but Churchill is what Halifax wants, and Halifax knows best. Churchill is a warhawk but he knows how to motivate and provide a figurehead for a population, and he will allow us to sustain the war with Germany and show them what it means to deny the will of Great Britain.
uk_negotiated_peace코0=Negotiated Peace
uk_negotiated_peace_desc코0=Halifax seeks a negotiated peace with Germany; Germany seeks not to be at war with the full force of the Allies. A match made in heaven that will allow for a white peace that prevents Britain from having to again feel the losses of the Great War.
uk_unthinkable코0=Operation Unthinkable
uk_unthinkable_desc코0=The war in Europe isn't over, not by a long ways; as long as the Red Menace remains a power the free world will not be able to rest easy. We must not allow the seeds to take root; we must oust the communists, destroy their fetid union, and finally secure a square deal for Poland and all other countries in their thrall.
uk_appease_italy코0=Appease Italy
uk_appease_italy_desc코0=Italy was once part of the Entente, and their potential alliance to the Reich and its ways is of a fragile sort formed from ideological bonds and resentment towards their so called 'mutilated victory'; by healing the wounds of that victory, we may be able to bring them back into the fold, denying Hitler a valuable ally.
uk_wartime_measures코0=Wartime Measures
uk_wartime_measures_desc코0=War, it seems, is upon us, and so we must begin to prepare; we cannot be left behind in the race to mobilise, especially with the headstart our enemies have enjoyed.
uk_rationing코0=Implement Rationing
uk_rationing_desc코0=The Kriegsmarine has denied our island nation of the food it desperately needs from abroad; it has become clear we must tighten the nations belts and ask every man, woman and child to go hungry for their country.
uk_dads_army코0=The Home Guard
uk_dads_army_desc코0=By establishing the home guard we utilise the manpower that we cannot utilise abroad in defense of the country; those too young or too old are free to serve in Dad's Army.
uk_enigma코0=Ultra
uk_enigma_desc코0=The Enigma Machine encryption must be cracked; doing so is vital for the war effort. To this effort we are putting our best mathematical minds to the task; Project Ultra is underway.
uk_vegetarian코0=Operation Vegetarian
uk_vegetarian_desc코0=By disseminating five million linseed cakes laced with anthrax spores into the food supply of German cattle, we will massively reduce their food supply and kill millions of Germans. While this operation, if successful, will doubtlessly be effective at castrating Germany, we will suffer major international backlash, and if we fail the German resolve may only be strengthened by such monstrous tactics...
uk_anthropoid코0=Operation Anthropoid
uk_anthropoid_desc코0=With the Czechoslovakian government in exile and the Butcher of Prague conducting his reign of terror there, it falls to us to plan his downfall; Heydrich being one of Hitler's top men, his death will demoralise both the leadership and the public in the Reich. We will conduct this mission in conjunction with the Czech resistance still in Czechoslovakia, as well as parachuting in Czech operatives.
uk_foxley코0=Operation Foxley
uk_foxley_desc코0=A desperate dream, with the weighty knowledge of many prior failures upon its back: to kill the Fuhrer and to destroy the Reich by cutting off the head of the snake.
uk_r4_1코0=Plan R4: Phase I
uk_r4_1_desc코0=Phase 1: Sieze the Danish Atlantic possessions.
uk_r4_2코0=Plan R4: Phase II
uk_r4_2_desc코0=Phase 2: Use these possessions as the staging platform for an invasion of Norway and Sweden, a supplier of iron ore to the German War Machine.
uk_civil_defence코0=Civil Defence Service
uk_civil_defence_desc코0=The Civil Defense Service will be vital in our at home anti-air capabilities: a volunteer and reservist force for organising responses to air raids, but civillian and military.
uk_xx코0=The Double-Cross System
uk_xx_desc코0=By using captured Nazi agents to disseminate disformation directly to their controllers, we can confuse and confound the Nazi's espionage efforts.
uk_mediterranean_fortress코0=Mediterranean Fortresses
uk_mediterranean_fortress_desc코0=The Mediterranean, while not immediately seeming a British interest, is our route through to Suez, and from there India and the Far East. Our dominance there must be preserved at all costs.
uk_fortify_suez코0=Secure Suez
uk_fortify_suez_desc코0=Suez is our lifeline to the eastern half of the Empire, and must be protected and maintained at all costs.
uk_fortify_cyprus코0=Fortify Cyprus
uk_fortify_cyprus_desc코0=Suez, important as it is, is best defended indirectly, with a large naval base on the nearby island of Cyprus to project power across the Mediterranean.
uk_fortify_gibraltar코0=Gibraltar Defence Force
uk_fortify_gibraltar_desc코0=The Rock of Gibraltar has stood as British for hundreds of years, and we shall see that none of the chaos in Spain or rising Italian ambitions do it harm.
uk_fortify_malta코0=Maltese Fortress
uk_fortify_malta_desc코0=Malta, lying awash between the southern shores of Italy proper, and the northern shores of Italy's colony in Africa, lies in grave danger. We must do all we can to ensure it remains a fortress in the midst of the enemy.
uk_libyan_forts코0=Libyan Border Fortifications
uk_libyan_forts_desc코0=Italy has clear ambitions in Africa, and the first stop, if not France, will be our possessions. We should fortify the habitable strip of land along the northern Egyptian coast, where they are sure to attack, to repel them should things come to blows.
uk_develop_india코0=Develop India
uk_develop_india_desc코0=The Jewel in the Crown of the British Empire seems tarnished and cracked these days; it is time to repair our point of pride.
uk_indian_universities코0=Indian Universities
uk_indian_universities_desc코0=There are great numbers of brilliant minds that go unfound and undeveloped in India; by opening universities we can massively increase the intellectual capabilities of the nation.
uk_indian_employment코0=Non-Discriminatory Employment
uk_indian_employment_desc코0=Why are we wasting so much talent based on such outdated and ridiculous concepts as caste and race? They are subjects of the British Empire, and they will serve it as such.
uk_shan_hills코0=Civilise the Shan Hills
uk_shan_hills_desc코0=The Shan Hils are impenetrable; jungle and hills as far as the eye can see. If we are to have a hope of a road to China through India, we will need to tame this wasted land.
uk_burma_focus코0=The Burma Road
uk_burma_focus_desc코0=We should aid the Chinese in their struggle against Japan by constructing a road - and associated infrastructure - between Burma and China where supplies can be reach them overland, safe from Japanese predation.
uk_develop_dominions코0=Develop the Dominions
uk_develop_dominions_desc코0=If an empire only serves to benefit its heartland, it will perish; we must bring the dominions closer to us by using the full force of the empire to assist them.
uk_develop_canada코0=Develop Canada
uk_develop_canada_desc코0=Much of Canada is a snowy and inhospitable waste; by building roads and infrastructure and improving the quality of life for all Canadians, we can reduce how much of the land mass is wasted.
uk_develop_sa코0=Develop South Africa
uk_develop_sa_desc코0=South Africa may be more hospitable than much of Africa proper, but the cape colony still needs the help of the empire; we will provide it by building roads, railways and factories so that they might better utilise their corner of the dark continent.
uk_develop_nz코0=Develop New Zealand
uk_develop_nz_desc코0=New Zealand is small island swallowed by brush and jungle; by building a major dockyard in Auckland and slashing and burning our way through that jungle, we can make it better suited to the purposes of the empire.
uk_develop_australia코0=Develop Australia
uk_develop_australia_desc코0=Australia is desert and jungle, unsuited to life aside from that endured by the aboriginals. By building irrigation networks and roads that will allow our people to survive further from the coast, we can better live in that wasteland.
uk_develop_africa코0=Develop Africa
uk_develop_africa_desc코0=We have carved large swathes of the dark continent for ourselves; now, with steel and railway and tarmac we must make it our own.
uk_develop_tanganyika코0=Convert German Sauerkraut Factories
uk_develop_tanganyika_desc코0=We must take what small developments Germany made to Tanganyika and expand upon them if we truly wish to show our domination.
uk_white_highlands코0=Encourage the White Highlands
uk_white_highlands_desc코0=The Kenyan Highlands reserved for settlement by white settlers from Britain are woefully undeveloped and unpopulated; by investing in the infrastructure there we can allow them to grow and develop into a place worth ruling.
uk_african_breadbasket코0=Breadbasket of Africa
uk_african_breadbasket_desc코0=Rhodesia is the breadbasket of our African Empire, just as Cyrenaica was the for the romans. If we wish to show our dedication to Africa we must develop it further.
uk_rhodesian_independence코0=The Central African Federation
uk_rhodesian_independence_desc코0=The settlers of Rhodesia clamour for independance from direct British rule and equal representation with the other dominions; how can we refuse?
uk_depth_defence코0=Defence in Depth
uk_depth_defence_desc코0=Our eastern territories, contrary to the position of the Singapore Strategy, will be best defended by greater closeness between the outposts of our Empire and a more integrated defence straetgy.
uk_fortify_ceylon코0=Malta of the East
uk_fortify_ceylon_desc코0=Beginning with the most Western outpost of this Far Eastern defence strategy, a developed Ceylon will serve well as a rear base for our Naval forces.
uk_seize_isthmus코0=Seize the Isthmus
uk_seize_isthmus_desc코0=Malaya can never truly be secure when it is territorially isolated from the Raj by Siam - we should coerce this small country into handing over their share of the peninsula so that we may secure it further.
uk_malaya_railway코0=Rangoon to Singapore Railway
uk_malaya_railway_desc코0=There is no use in an overland passage to Singapore if we cannot move men along it, and for that purpose we shall develop a railway to tie together the territory.
uk_asia_troops코0=Reinforce the Far East
uk_asia_troops_desc코0=With our defensive strategy in place, now all that remains is to actually move in the men to do the fighting.
uk_singapore_strat코0=The Singapore Strategy
uk_singapore_strat_desc코0=Orthodox works best, as is the British way, and our current strategy of Singapore as a hardy fortress from which we can project power over the East and recover any lost territories in the immediate event of a war with Japan shall continue to serve us well.
uk_landward_fortifications코0=Landward Fortifications
uk_landward_fortifications_desc코0=Singapore will not be much use should it fall under attack from through the thick jungle to the north. Let us fortify our border with Siam to prevent such a catastrophe.
uk_peninsular_bastions코0=Peninsular Bastions
uk_peninsular_bastions_desc코0=Singapore serves well as a lone island of security in the eastern seas, but it would serve even better supported by a network of fortified cities across Malaya.
uk_total_defence코0=Total Defence
uk_total_defence_desc코0=To cap off our plans to turn Malaya into a veritable British fortress in the Far East, we should undertake the installation of anti-air emplacements and radar towers, to ensure a holistic and total defence.
uk_appease_italy_2코0=African Concessions
uk_appease_italy_2_desc코0=It is time to discuss that most obvious of Italian ambitions, their desires for Africa.
uk_appease_italy_3코0=Mare Adriaticum
uk_appease_italy_3_desc코0=Italy wishes to approach us again, this time on the issue of their Balkan ambitions.
uk_appease_italy_4코0=The Entente Revived
uk_appease_italy_4_desc코0=We have gone along with them long enough. It is time for Italy to join us!
uk_balkan_strategy코0=Defend the Balkans!
uk_balkan_strategy_desc코0=Many of the nations in the Balkans are pro-British and see the same threat from central Europe as we do. If we seize the opportunity and support them early, we can secure their loyalty, although at the expense of angering their revengist neighbors.
uk_provoke_italy_2코0=Reassure Greece
uk_provoke_italy_2_desc코0=Greece, at the southern tip of Europe, lies threatened by Italian-aligned Albania to the north, and their navy to the west. We shall ensure they remain unmolested.
uk_provoke_italy_3코0=Dinaric Forts
uk_provoke_italy_3_desc코0=Yugoslavia faces the most immediate and grave threat from Italian imperialism and German expansionism, lying right on their North-Western border. We should aid them in fortifying their coastline & border, so that the Fascists can be repulsed.
uk_provoke_italy_4코0=Invite the Balkan States
uk_provoke_italy_4_desc코0=Simply some fortification construction is not enough - it's time for the Balkan States to be welcomed into the Allies on level footing.
uk_rearmament코0=Begin Rearmament
uk_rearmament_desc코0=Our war industry is sadly lacking and unmodernised; if we are to be an effectively mobilised nation we must correct this.
uk_mi코0=Military-Industrial Development
uk_mi_desc코0=Our war industry is sadly lacking and unmodernised; if we are to be an effectively mobilised nation we must correct this.
uk_research_slot코0=Applied Research
uk_research_slot_desc코0=We must apply our intellectual capabilities towards the war effort; awaken the sleeping technological titans of Cambridge, Oxford, York and Manchester: we have need of them.
uk_nuclear_a코0=Anglo-American Nuclear Development
uk_nuclear_a_desc코0=It is clear that though we are ahead of them in Nuclear development, we simply do not have the productive capability to back it up that the Americans do; the solution clear, a joint effort is required.
uk_nuclear_b코0=Tube Alloys
uk_nuclear_b_desc코0=In preparation for an all-out conflict, the type of which we have never even seen before, it is time to put our best minds to work on developing new, advanced means of waging war, bombs greater than anything we have previously known. This effort shall be higher than top secret, kept hush-hush and referred to only in code names at the highest levels of government. 'Tube Alloys' sounds dull enough.
uk_carrots코0=Growing Carrots
uk_carrots_desc코0=No, of course we aren't developing a new technology for spotting enemy planes! We just...we just eat a lot of carrots, giving our pilots a wondrous eyesight! Yes, that's it!
uk_missiles코0=Perfect the Unrotated Projectile
uk_missiles_desc코0=Though our earlier forms proved ineffectual and unreliable, we must still strive to perfect it; the unrotated missile and its technological brethren could very well be the weapons of the future.
uk_shadow_scheme코0=The Shadow Scheme
uk_shadow_scheme_desc코0=By using our civillian motor industry to reinforce our aerial military industry, we can bolster our mobilisation efforts without great economic and social upheaval.
uk_rof코0=Royal Ordinance Factories
uk_rof_desc코0=Our ordinance production is woefully low, and there is only thing for it: fire up the furnaces, and let the smokestacks belch our discontent into the sky, for the British Lion prepares for war.
uk_coastal_forts코0=South Coast Fortifications
uk_coastal_forts_desc코0=Britain's soft underbelly is undefended: a soft underbelly that our enemies will strike at at the first opportunity. We must harden our nation; build the coastal forts, let not a single invader step upon Britain's shores.
uk_anti_air코0=Comprehensive Air Defence
uk_anti_air_desc코0=Our enemies will seek to cripple us, starve us, destroy us, without a single boot on the ground; we must show them that as Britannia rules the waves, she also grips the sky!
uk_british_army코0=The British Army
uk_british_army_desc코0=Founded in 1660, proudly once one of the best fighting forces in the world, the British Army stands to attention when the Lion roars.
uk_gbp_1코0=Lessons of the Great War
uk_gbp_1_desc코0=The Great War was horrifying, and was a demonstration of the new war that we face; if we are to evolve and thrive, we must learn our lesson.
uk_gbp_2코0=Personal Submachine Guns
uk_gbp_2_desc코0=By arming each man with a person submachine gun we enhance the individual fighting strength of each unit, strengthening the overall fighting force.
uk_gbp_3코0=Modern Army
uk_gbp_3_desc코0=The Modern Army must not simply be fighting men; it must be engineers, medics, scouts and all manner of support personnel that mean that less lives are lost and more ground gained.
uk_sfp_1코0=Shells are Cheaper than Men
uk_sfp_1_desc코0=Too many British lives were lost in the war to end all wars; if we are to truly learn our lessons, we must learn that any future warfare must reduce British casualties while enhancing those we inflict on the enemy; to this end, we will expand our artillery.
uk_sfp_2코0=Line Artillery
uk_sfp_2_desc코0=Artillery will be the core of our new British army, and with our superior firepower we will blow the stinking rats free of their fortifications with no effort at all.
uk_sfp_3코0=Armoured Speartip
uk_sfp_3_desc코0=The new cavalry, and the most effective way of keeping our men alive; we must use our tanks to pierce and shatter the enemy frontlines so that they will scatter like the roaches they are.
uk_conscription코0=Military Training Act
uk_conscription_desc코0=The time for mourning the last war is over. The old Lion needs men yet again, and Britain's masses will answer dutifully.
uk_enfields코0=Enfield Armoury Contracts
uk_enfields_desc코0=The Royal Small Arms Factory of Enfield has been government owned and producing armaments for the crown since 1816; it is a dependable institution that we shall rely upon for the manufacture of small arms in this war also.
uk_SAS코0=Special Air Service
uk_SAS_desc코0=Our Special Forces are lacking; it is time to call upon brave men to become Britain's new elite fighting force: the SAS.
uk_navy코0=Britannia Rule the Waves
uk_navy_desc코0=Britain's Navy is her pride and joy, and like any Navy must adapt, change and evolve as time moves on. We must grow to suit a changing world.
uk_fib_1코0=Command of the Sea
uk_fib_1_desc코0=While change is needed, perhaps not too much. Our basic doctrine of overwhelming power at sea preventing any country from even dreaming of confronting us suits fine.
uk_fib_2코0=Battleship Flagship
uk_fib_2_desc코0=The old ways our best, and as the Dreadnoughts saw us through WW1, new types of Battleships at the centre of our fleets will see us through this war.
uk_fib_3코0=Carrier Flagship
uk_fib_3_desc코0=Battleships are no longer enough - the tides are turning, and Carriers are the way of the future.
uk_tid_1코0=The British Kraken
uk_tid_1_desc코0=As we saw in the last war, strangulation of merchant shipping deals the death blow to a country more than anything else. It is time for us to move to a new type of doctrine.
uk_tid_2코0=Submarine Warfare
uk_tid_2_desc코0=Submarines are at the heart of our Trade Interdiction Doctrine, and we should focus on them first.
uk_tid_3코0=Cruiser Fleet
uk_tid_3_desc코0=Submarines are easily felled from above, and thus we should maintain our surface-going Navy to keep control over the waves.
uk_raf코0=Per Ardua ad Astra
uk_raf_desc코0='Through adversity to the stars', so goes the RAF motto. Through the smoke and salt of the coming conflicts, we shall rise to become greater than ever, supported by our Air Force.

uk_coastal_command코0=Coastal Command
uk_coastal_command_desc코0=As part of our reorganisation and defensive realignment of our air force, we should establish a unique Coastal command for overseeing our navy.
uk_dowding코0=Dowding System
uk_dowding_desc코0=The world's first wide-area ground-controlled interception network, the Dowding System is a network of telephone landlines, radar stations and groups of auxiliary observers to spot enemy planes entering British airspace and rapidly alert our forces.
uk_bomber_stream코0=Bomber Stream
uk_bomber_stream_desc코0=Where once we cowered in small numbers, we shall now fall upon the enemy with vast swarms of bomber-planes, blotting out the sun and hitting in such numbers that their defence will simply fall apart.
uk_cas코0=Fleet Air Arm
uk_cas_desc코0=We are entering a new Naval age - the primacy of old Battleships & Dreadnoughts is falling, and the position of Carriers rises in the opposite direction. We should establish a new joint air-naval wing with the intention of fully staffing our carriers under the Coastal Command.
uk_jets코0=Jet Research
uk_jets_desc코0=Jet research meaning faster, slimmer, more powerful planes is the way of the future. We must move along with this, or risk falling behind.
uk_lapg코0=L.A.P.G
uk_lapg_desc코0=In conjuction with our Shadow Scheme, we should designate some of these factories to be focused on Air Production, with a mind to expanding our air fleet.
uk_air_training코0=Empire Air Training Scheme
uk_air_training_desc코0=Our manpower is stretched and thinly-spread; we should put effort into training those pilots we have well, and also recruiting willing pilot volunteers from across the Empire and the world to fly our planes.
uk_marines코0=Royal Marines
uk_marines_desc코0=As is neccessary for any island nation, we have a long and glorious tradiiton of British Royal Marines - in the coming conflicts they will no doubt again see combat, for which they must be ready.
uk_federation코0=Imperial Federation
uk_federation_desc코0=Talk of the neccessity to federalise the Empire to counter the growing independence of the Dominions and the allegedly inevitable collapse of the Empire as a world power due to the growing power of the Soviet Union & United States has been going around in many circles since the turn of the century, but now it has achieved official attention.
uk_imperial_preference코0=Imperial Preference
uk_imperial_preference_desc코0=Imperial Preference, the system of intra-Imperial free trade and prioritising Empire goods over others, even when they may be cheaper, is a policy that would go a long way to assuaging the economic. fears of the Dominions.
uk_agricultural_council코0=Empire Agricultural Council
uk_agricultural_council_desc코0=By coordinating the Empire's food needs with a central committee, we can achieve agricultural autarky without need for reliance on outside powers.
uk_constitution코0=Sign Imperial Constitution
uk_constitution_desc코0=It is time! With the assent of our major Dominions, we are finally in a position to sign the Imperial Constitution. Things will need to be hashed out in the coming negotiations, but we shall certainly see the reorganisation of the legislature into a tricameral, or possibly even greater, system of Imperial Parliaments, and soon after the resignation of our King-Emperor as simply Federal Emperor.
uk_native_representation코0=African Representation
uk_native_representation_desc코0=With Federation and the representation of our settler colonies in the Imperial Parliaments, the demands of the Indians for representation or independence have grown louder. We find that the former would be more acceptable to us.
uk_empire_fleet코0=Reorganize the Imperial Fleet
uk_empire_fleet_desc코0=The Fleet's integration with Dominion & Colonial forces has been a messy affair, and a number of issues have arisen, especially with force allocation. It is time to review our positions, leadership and general defensive strategy.
uk_empire_army코0=Central Imperial Army Command
uk_empire_army_desc코0=The integration of the Dominion Armies and Colonial Garrisons & Militias into the Imperial Army has been less than smooth - reorganisations are needed to reshape it into an effective fighting force, starting with the establishment of a central command.
uk_indian_mps코0=Indian MPs
uk_indian_mps_desc코0=With Federation and the representation of our settler colonies in the Imperial Parliaments, the demands of the Indians for representation or independence have grown louder. We find that the former would be more acceptable to us.
uk_empire_ireland코0=Restore Ireland
uk_empire_ireland_desc코0=Ireland has gone astray! Their relation to the British Empire has been nothing more than a formality since 1937. It is time to reintegrate them into the Federation.
uk_mw_1코0=Begin Motorization
uk_mw_1_desc코0=As the Experimental Mechanized Force clearly showed, mobility on the battlefield trumps sheer weight of fire, something our generals have until now tragically neglected. We must correct this, and begin the process of building up our motorised capacity to allow our forces the ease of manuver sufficent to prevent another deadlock.
uk_mw_2코0=The Universal Carrier
uk_mw_2_desc코0=Though already in widespread production, the Universal Carrier has yet to be fully embraced by our armed forces. The diminutive vehicle may lack the full protection of larger vehicles, but is an incredibly capable tractor, troop carrier, and scout vehicle. We must contact Vickers-Armstrongs for sufficent mass-orders to build up large stocks of the vehicle!
uk_empire_america코0=Restore North American Territories
uk_empire_america_desc코0=We have a number of dormant claims in America; British Columbia, but also that to the entire Thirteen Colonies, which were ripped from us long ago by upstart settlers. Now that the Empire stands united, federated and unbreakable, it is time for us to bring our most distant child back into the fold.
uk_empire_africa코0=The British Continent
uk_empire_africa_desc코0=The British have a right to Africa. While other Empires exploit, butcher and brutalise the local population, we seek nothing more than the spread of civilisation, the Christian faith and our prosperity.
uk_empire_china코0=Seize South China
uk_empire_china_desc코0=South China has long been counted as part of our 'Informal Empire', areas where we possess such economic hegemony they may as well be our colonies. Perhaps it's time to formalise that particular arrangement.
uk_empire_indochina코0=Assert Indochina Hegemony
uk_empire_indochina_desc코0=With South China in our grasp, Indochina is increasingly sticking out as an unpleasant spot in the growing British South Asian Empire. Let's clean it up.
uk_hobarts_funnies코0=Hobart's Funnies
uk_hobarts_funnies_desc코0=With increasingly heavy chassis and powerful suspension systems at the disposal of our engineers, some attempts have been made to mate bridge laying equiptment, flamethrowers, and demolition mortors with infantry tanks' hulls. We should standardise and universalise the succesful models under a uniform 'AVRE' distinction.
uk_mw_3코0=Mechanise the Artillery
uk_mw_3_desc코0=The ability to rapidly displace bases of fire over broken ground and across great distances is decisive. Whilst we already have schemes to put artillery behind motorised traction, we could act even more boldly if the artillery were given it's own mechanised mounting.
uk_mw_4코0=Universalise the Mechanised Force
uk_mw_4_desc코0=No longer experimental, we have come a long way from Salsbury Plain. Our experience has shown the enormous power of mobile, responsive units, and now the time has come to formulate a new divisional structure to incorporate these changes.
uk_gbp_4코0=Infantry Tank Primacy
uk_gbp_4_desc코0=The cult of the offensive cost us dearly in the last war. To best effect a breakthrough, heavily armoured tanks must suppliment our leg-infantry as they defeat enemy defenses.
uk_iraq_focus코0=Secure Iraq
uk_iraq_focus_desc코0=We granted Iraq independence in 1932, but considering the current global situation, that might have been a mistake. Iraqi oil must never be allowed to reach our enemies, especially taking into account the considerable amount of influence the Germans and Italians have in the area.
uk_iran_focus코0=Secure Iran
uk_iran_focus_desc코0=Collectivist influence is suspected to be spreading among the Iranian leadership.  We cannot allow this to happen, lest it creates another liability for our war effort. Iran is not just rich in oil that must be denied our enemies; it is also the strategic nexus between India, the Middle East and the Soviet Union.
uk_air_rearmament_focus코0=Air Rearmament
uk_air_rearmament_focus_desc코1=[Root.GetAirRearmamentDesc]
uk_chiefs_of_staff_committee코1=Chiefs of Staff Committee
uk_chiefs_of_staff_committee_desc코1=We must empower the heads of the various service branches to conduct this war as they consider is best. The Combined Chiefs of Staff, formed initially in 1923, will now be given the means to coordinate operations across the globe, reporting directly to the War Cabinet. This will greatly streamline planning for military operations.
uk_royal_economic_reform코0=Royal Economic Reform
uk_royal_economic_reform_desc코0=His royal highness is seeking to reform certain corrupt financial practices by instituting greater oversight and hedgemony over the relevant economic sectors.


colonial_independence코0=Forge our own Path
colonial_independence_desc코0=The world is changing! Old powers are falling, new powers rise in Europe and the Far East, and the grip of the old European masters on their overseas possessions slips more with every passing day. It is decolonisation or death!
colonial_fascism코0=The Bullet
colonial_fascism_desc코0=The Europeans have derived us of our pride, our customs, our very nationhood. It is time to unite as one, purge the undesirable and the degenerate influences of society, and rise against the oppressors.
colonial_gangs코0=Armed Gangs
colonial_gangs_desc코0=Formation of nationalistically-minded armed gangs, similar to the Brownshirts & Blackshirts of Germany and Italy to enforce our new popular movement among those who might collaborate or apologise for the European oppressors will help to further our cause and solidify control.
colonial_fashy_state코0=The New State
colonial_fashy_state_desc코0=Now at the reins of the country, we are in a position at last to implement our agenda of national rebirth.
colonial_democracy코0=The Ballot Box
colonial_democracy_desc코0=The Europeans have brought us many things, good and bad, but their parliamentary democracy is undoubtedly their finest creation. Yet their beliefs in liberty are a hypocrisy to those who they crush underfoot for their own gain, so it is time to use their own concepts against them.
colonial_protests코0=Satyagraha
colonial_protests_desc코0=As we see from the National Congress in India, a path to freedom is best tread lightly and peacefully, not with terrorism or violence; as even the European's best attempts at obfuscation cannot deny the righteousness of a nation yearning to be free to their populace
colonial_nice_nationalism코0=Civic Nationalism
colonial_nice_nationalism_desc코0=We are a nation, an ancient and proud one, slowly freeing ourselves of foreign control and influence. Where the European taught us we are savage, backwards, uneducated, we shall show them we can stand shoulder-to-shoulder in all affairs with our former masters.
colonial_communism코0=The Bomb
colonial_communism_desc코0=The changes the Europeans have brought to our country will never go away; industrialisation, modernisation, capitalism, all of these now mire our land forever. The society they seek to impose on us is inherently hierarchical, oppressive and exploitative, and only by throwing away every last vestige of their influence here will we be free.
colonial_direct_action코0=Direct Action
colonial_direct_action_desc코0=If Imperialists could be talked down, we would be free men. We are not, and it's time to show them the time for talk is over.
colonial_civil_war코0=War of Liberation
colonial_civil_war_desc코0=Tension has reached a boiling point. The people cry out to be free. No more shall we accept unjust tax, oppression - no more gods, no more masters. Vive la Revolution!
colonial_postcolonial코0=Postcolonial Reform
colonial_postcolonial_desc코0=It has been a long road. We are free - the battle is over. It is time to lick our wounds, and begin to heal this country for the long roads ahead.
colonial_conquest코0=Territorial Nationalism
colonial_conquest_desc코0=The Europeans split and divided us into assigned groups, seeking to break us up to make us weaker. To become strong again, we need to throw away these false divisions and take back what is ours.
colonial_loyalty코0=Remain Loyal
colonial_loyalty_desc코0=To maintain law and order, civilisation and the spread of prosperity, trade and mutual interest, we shall uphold this union.
colonial_settlement코0=Encourage European Settlement
colonial_settlement_desc코0=No matter how much we develop this land, we can never quite be sure of the allegiances of the local people. Importing European settlers will allow us to grow a population that unquestionably will be overwhelmingly loyal to the colonial authoritires whom serve their interests.
colonial_elites코0=Cooperate with Local Elites
colonial_elites_desc코0=If we are to govern here peacefully, and develop amicably with the local peoples, making accords with their pre-existing power structures will serve us better than trying to uproot them.
colonial_police_desc코0=Where there was chaos, the Bobbies will bring order.
colonial_apartheid코0=Racial Discrimination
colonial_apartheid_desc코0=The people of this land are inferior, and try as we may to uplift them, they shall never be our equals. Their land is rich, beautiful and it's resources better serve our race - to this end we shall continue the import of European settlers, while keeping the native population under a close watch.
colonial_citizenship코0=Universal Citizenship
colonial_citizenship_desc코0=Our mission here is nothing more than to uplift the peoples of this land. Slowly, we see this taking shape, and it would now seem the local population are of a level of development enough to introduce democracy to them.
colonial_divide코0=Divide and Rule
colonial_divide_desc코0=To maintain our power here, and continue the flow of raw goods and money for the Empire, we would do best to distract the local people so they cannot rise up against us. What better way to focus their anger than to divide them into classes, ethnic groups, and promote differences amongst them so that they will turn on each other.
colonial_model코0=Model Colony
colonial_model_desc코0=Our work has been successful. Peace, prosperity, commerce and civilisation reigns over this land for the first time. Huzzah!
colonial_fleet_desc코0=We serve best as a naval outpost, and for those purposes it is neccessary that we develop a strong naval presence here.
colonial_coastal_defence코0=Coastal Defence
colonial_coastal_defence_desc코0=Principally we are overseas instruments of our Colonial Master, projecting their sea power further abroad with our bases. Thus, our own fleet needs to be nothing more than a coastal defence force to ward off minor threats.
colonial_submarines_desc코0=If we are to be sucked into any war or large engagement, our small force will serve best by employing a strategy of cutting off the enemy's trade and convoys with a fleet of submarines.
colonial_big_navy코0=Independent Navy
colonial_big_navy_desc코0=Founded first as just an outpost for a larger naval force, it is time that we develop our own capabilities.
colonial_flagship코0=Construct a Flagship
colonial_flagship_desc코0=Any modern navy needs a hi-tech, state-of-the-art flagship at the centre of it's force, and we should begin work immediately.
colonial_naval_academy코0=Local Naval Academy
colonial_naval_academy_desc코0=To any armed force, land or sea, a well-trained, disciplined and cool-minded officer corps is absolutely essential to maintaining a functional force.
colonial_dockyards코0=Expand Coaling Stations
colonial_dockyards_desc코0=To meet our growing naval demands, we should upgrade the old colonial coaling stations into modern dockyards, naval bases and other coastal installations to serve the needs of our forces.
colonial_army_desc코0=To repulse threats and to defend ourselves, we need a modern, well-equipped and well-trained armed force.
colonial_army_equipment코0=Small Arms Developments
colonial_army_equipment_desc코0=By importing and developing our own modern small arms, man-to-man our troops will have an advantage over whomever we fight against.
colonial_army_motorization코0=Basic Motorization
colonial_army_motorization_desc코0=Walking is going out of fashion, and lumbering mechanized carriers are coming in.
colonial_army_artillery코0=Artillery Support
colonial_army_artillery_desc코0=Men are costly, shells are cheap; supported by the economic strength of our homeland, we can afford to develop artillery support to ensure as little of (our) lives are lost as possible.
colonial_army_tanks코0=Tank Experiments
colonial_army_tanks_desc코0=If we are to develop a truly modern, mechanised force, we must have a small corps of tanks, learning from the landships of the last war.
colonial_army_support코0=Support Company Integration
colonial_army_support_desc코0=No man fights alone - behind him is a whole country, officers, workers, nurses, technicians, and increasingly large clusters of tents full of these men & women, indispensible to the modern soldier.
colonial_airforce코0=Air Auxiliaries
colonial_airforce_desc코0=Mastery of the sky is becoming more and more crucial upon the modern battlefield, and we had best keep up or risk being left behind.
colonial_modernisation코0=Begin Economic Modernisation
colonial_modernisation_desc코0=The winds of change are working themselves up into a veritable gale, and it's time for us to move with the world, or be left behind.
colonial_resources코0=New Extraction Methods
colonial_resources_desc코0=We preside over a resource-rich land, and using modern extraction techniques we can reap even greater rewards.
colonial_railways_1코0=Rail Links
colonial_railways_1_desc코0=Railways bind a country together, uniting it into one big village and strengthening a unified national feeling.
colonial_railways_2코0=Domestic Railway Companies
colonial_railways_2_desc코0=By reducing our reliance on overseas construction companies and opening our own firms to manage the local transport network, we can better improve our economic independence.
colonial_factories_1코0=Basic Industrial Development
colonial_factories_1_desc코0=To grow and modernise our economy we should begin to industrialise the country.
colonial_factories_2코0=Settler Entrepreneurs
colonial_factories_2_desc코0=Instead of relying on overseas companies to build and run our factories, we should promote a spirit of entrepreneurship among the settlers here to begin their own businesses, supported by the government.
colonial_research코0=Establish Universities
colonial_research_desc코0=Universities for both the settler & native population will help grow our literate, learned population and improve our production
colonial_research_military코0=Military Research Grants
colonial_research_military_desc코0=Storm clouds gather on the horizon, and we had best be ready for them. Using our newfound academic bedrock, we should put our efforts into cutting-edge military research.
colonial_research_civilian코0=Civilian Research Grants
colonial_research_civilian_desc코0=With science, technology and a spirit of industry we can change this world, make it better, happier and healthier for all of mankind.

### EVENTS
britain.9.t코0=Chamberlain Resigns
britain.9.d코0=With the war developing to the detriment of us and our allies, the Prime Minister has come under fire for both his peacetime and wartime decisions at critical junctions. At a moment when Britain needs to stand united more than ever, it finds itself divided as portions of the parliament holds Chamberlain in contempt.\n\nLacking vital support from Labour, the Prime Minister has made the decision to resign, favoring Lord Halifax as his replacement. However, Halifax has been skeptical and Chamberlain has advised the King to call on Winston Churchill. Halifax has popular support, but Churchill's prewar remarks now seem prescient, and a bulldog like him may be what we need for the coming war.
britain.9.a코0=Churchill will see us through.
britain.9.b코0=Halifax is the more sensible option.

britain.10.t코0=Chamberlain Passes Away
britain.10.d코0=Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain has fallen ill recently, despite previously generally having been healthy for his age. After being diagnosed with bowel cancer, increased pain and lost sleep has led him to resign from his post. Chamberlain still enjoys strong popular support and steps down only as a last resort, realizing he will not live to return to work.\n\nThe question remains who will take up the torch after this great statesman and lead Britain through the dark times that may still lie ahead of us.
britain.10.a코0=Churchill will see us through.
britain.10.b코0=Halifax is the more sensible option.

britain.24.t코0=Wallis Simpson
britain.24.d코0=The new King-Emperor is a boyish and troublesome sort, prone to rudeness, defiance of tradition and worst of all, womanising. His latest affair is with a twice-divorced American socialite, Wallis Simpson - whom he declares his intent to marry.  This presents a potential constitutional crisis, as the Church of England, which the British monarch presides over, forbids remarriage after divorce, not to even mention Simpson's low birth.  Neither the British people nor those of our Dominions abroad will accept this American as queen - while we have managed to keep the media silent at home, the press runs wild abroad, and it will not be long before the British public catch wind of this scandal.
britain.24.a코0=This will have to get sorted out before the coronation

britain.25.t코0=Abdication Crisis
britain.25.d코0=As the coronation draws nearer, concern regarding the new King-Emperor's engagement to Wallis Simpson grows. The Dominion Prime Ministers have unanimously rejected her as a match for the British Sovereign, and the Baldwin government is threatening to collectively resign. The monarch now faces a simple choice - love, or duty?
britain.25.a코0=What good is being a King if you can't marry the one you love?
britain.25.b코0=She will have to go for the good of the Empire

britain.26.t코0=Coronation of Edward VIII
britain.26.d코0=With the issue of Wallis Simpson long since cleared away, the coronation of the new British Sovereign has gone ahead smoothly. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the mountains of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins bearing his unusually left-facing portrait have gone out across the Empire, along with stamps and other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world.
britain.26.a코0=God save the King!

britain.27.t코0=Coronation of George VI
britain.27.d코0=With the short and troubled reign of Edward VIII now behind the Empire, the rule of the previously little-known George VI has been ushered in with bombastic fashion. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as George VI, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the wastes of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins and stamps bearing the monarch's image have gone out across the Empire, along with other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world.
britain.27.a코0=God save the King!

britain.28.t코0=Newfoundland Referendum
britain.28.d코0=In an early step towards a new policy of colonial self-determination, the citizens of Newfoundland have gone to the polls to decide the future of their country, and have voted by only a slim majority to join Canada.
britain.28.a코0=O, Canada!

britain.29.t코0=The Battle of Cable Street
britain.29.d코0=Oswald Mosley's growing blackshirt street movement, the British Union of Fascists have declared their intent to march through the heart of London's East End, in full uniform before it's large Jewish population. Fearing violence, the Home Secretary has sent a police escort to help the march continue - but local communists, socialists, anarchists, Jews and labour activists have not been detered, and promise Mosley a fight.
britain.29.a코0=The antifascists turn the marchers back.
britain.29.b코0=The blackshirts break through and march through the East End.
britain.29.c코0=The antifascists turn the tables on the blackshirts.
britain.29.e코0=Send in the Military to end this chaos.

britain.30.t코0=The British Revolution
britain.30.d코0=With London still recovering from the turmoil of last week's sudden and violent revolution, the Empire is still reeling. The unbelievable events in the British Metropole have left the extremities of our Empire, ideologically opposed to the new British government and constitutionally vexed, seeking to tread their own path.
britain.30.a코0=Traitors, the lot of them!

britain.31.t코0=North America goes its own way!
britain.31.d코0=At some point before the storming of Buckingham Palace, the British Monarchy fled to Canada, which has now declared itself an independent constitutional monarchy and seized Newfoundland. In the Caribbean, a loose coalition of island states have formed up the West Indies Federation from our territories there.
britain.31.a코0=God help us...

britain.32.t코0=India goes its own way!
britain.32.d코0=The conservative Anglo-Indian elite, now standing alone as the dominant minority in India, unable to accept the radical change in the regime of the metropole, have declared their independence from the Empire, with the smaller outposts in South Asia joining them willingly.
britain.32.a코0=God help us...

britain.33.t코0=The vultures pick over Africa
britain.33.d코0=The Afrikaners of South Africa, never friends to the British, have declared their independence as a republic and seized Bechuanaland. To the north, the already quasi-independent Rhodesias have cast off the British shackles along with Nyasaland. Our colonies in West & East Africa have been seized by France & Italy, who will no doubt lead our territories to ruin.
britain.33.a코0=God help us...

britain.34.t코0=Oceania goes its own way!
britain.34.d코0=Australia and New Zealand have proclaimed their independence as republics, and assumed control of our surrounding island colonies. While pledging they will return to the fold should 'civilised rule' ever be restored to Britain, it is looking unlikely.
britain.34.a코0=God help us...

britain.35.t코0=The vultures pick over the Near East
britain.35.d코0=France has assumed control of all territories from the Suez Canal up to the border of their own Syria, while the Greeks of Cyprus have at last achieved their Enosis, and our remaining scattered territories did not last long before being snapped up by whichever backwater Sultanates held a grudge against our Empire.
britain.35.a코0=God help us...

britain.36.t코0=Britain proposes Syndicalisation
britain.36.d코0=It is no secret the red tide of communism, socialism, and anarchism is on the rise in Ireland. Winning increasing seats in parliament and making themselves worryingly visible on the streets of Dublin, it seems only a matter of time until we are swamped by them. No doubt responsible for at least some of this, across the Irish Sea the British Federation has given us a tantalising offer. A United Irish Syndicate, on the same standing with Wales & Scotland. While this may seem to be vassalisation under any other name, the acquisition of the Six Counties is a long-coveted prize...
britain.36.a코0=It seems this would be our best move
britain.36.b코0=Outrageous! Absolutely not

britain.37.t코0=Ireland refuses Syndicalisation!
britain.37.d코0=The telegram has come back from Dublin, and Ireland has refused our generous offer for a united Irish syndicate!
britain.37.a코0=Absurd! It may be time to start looking at other methods...

britain.38.t코0=Anthrax attack averted!
britain.38.d코0=A dastardly British plan, intent on poisoning German cattle with anthrax, thus disseminating the plague to the rest of the German population, has thankfully been thwarted by our Abwehr agents. A number of disguised British special agents were detained near Greifswald, and after interrogation revealed the nature of their mission. Such barbarity in what we have been waging as a civilised war is almost unthinkable. Truly, the British can never be trusted.
britain.38.a코0=How could they even conceive of something like this?

britain.39.t코0=Devastating Anthrax attack!
britain.39.d코0=The unthinkable has befallen us. Agents of a hostile foreign government, Britain it would seem, have managed to infect massive quantities of German cattle with anthrax spores, which have begun to spread ceaselessly to the civilian population. Our attempts to contain the outbreak are ongoing, but the ramifications are immediate. Bodies line the streets, entire towns lie empty, with massive groups of refugees fleeing from the country to the cities in hope of safety, only exacerbating the food crisis brought on by the extermination of such large numbers of cattle. The army is in disarray. Our top scientists predict many of the infected areas will not be able to be inhabitable again for several decades. The Fuhrer has pledged retaliation, but in the state we are in, it seems doubtful that we will be able to.
britain.39.a코0=There are no words...

britain.40.t코0=Failure of Operation Vegetarian
britain.40.d코0=Despite our best efforts, our attempts at executing Operation Vegetarian have failed. With our on the ground personnel MIA and presumed in captivity, there is no doubt their air defences will be on high alert, preventing airborne shipments of the infected material being distributed. It won't be long before this comes out to the Intelligence communities of our fellow allied nations, and to the world - it is doubtful they will understand the direness of our situation.
britain.40.a코0=Drat.

britain.41.t코0=Operation Vegetarian succeeds!
britain.41.d코0=Against all odds, the plan has worked! Anthrax-infected linseed cakes having been distributed to of German cattle, the poisoned meat has gone out to the German population, who have already begun dying in droves. It seems we have 'succeeded', but... the scenes we see now in Germany have lead many wonder to if this was the right course to take. Large numbers of the British population are themselves horrified by this choice, and we find ourselves condemned by our fellow Allied leaders. This may be a bridge too far.
britain.41.a코0=May God forgive us.

britain.42.t코0=Assassination attempt averted
britain.42.d코0=Men of the Führerbegleitkommando today apprehended two British agents and arrested a local collaborator near the Berghof, Hitler's personal residency in the Bavarian Alps. They are currently being subjected to questioning, but this would appear to be an attempted assassination! In response, vigilance has been raised and the SS, Abwehr, Gestapo and other security apparatus of the state are on high alert.
britain.42.a코0=That was close...

britain.43.t코0=The Fuhrer is dead
britain.43.d코0=Today, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. All nearby towns have been put under lockdown, and a massive investigation has come underway to find every single traitor responsible for this. In accordance with the Fuhrer's will, Hermann Goering has stepped up as new Fuhrer of the German Reich. We are still preparing on how to best break this news to the German public.
britain.43.a코0=Without him, we may truly be lost.

britain.44.t코0=British Anthrax attack on Germany
britain.44.d코0=The British, abandoning all codes and norms of civilised society and warfare, have done the unthinkable. Using anthrax-infected linseed cakes distributed to German cattle, they have wrought chemical warfare on a scale never seen before on this planet - as of yet, possible millions of Germans lie dead, soldiers and civilians alike. Britain's allies and enemies alike have condemned this senseless act of brutality. While the Fuhrer has issued vows of retaliation, his personal status and that of many other high-ranking Nazi officials remains unclear.
britain.44.a코0=How could they even think of such a thing?

britain.45.t코0=Operation Foxley failure
britain.45.d코0=Not even managing to lay eyes on Hitler, and apparently given away by a relative of the German villager aiding them, our two men sent in to Bavaria with the aim of killing the Fuhrer have been captured. German press releases show they have caught on to their mission and hightened security around Hitler - any such further assaults on the Fuhrer's person are now out of the question.
britain.45.a코0=It was always a long shot.

britain.46.t코0=Hitler assassinated!
britain.46.d코0=A few days ago, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. A massive investigation between all arms of the German state have descended on Bavaria, intent on rooting out any even remotely connected with the murder of their Fuhrer. Hermann Goering has been appointed the new Fuhrer in accordance with Hitler's will, and vows the war will continue.
britain.46.a코0=Unbelievable!

britain.47.t코0=Britain demands North Atlantic possessions!
britain.47.d코0=Britain has issued a demand, insisting that the present war situation requires their navy to assume control over our Atlantic Possessions, Iceland & the Faroe Islands. Greenland has, for whatever reason, been spared.
britain.47.a코0=We would not seem to have much choice...
britain.47.b코0=Outrageous, absolutely not!

britain.48.t코0=Denmark accedes!
britain.48.d코0=Denmark has accepted our demands that we assume control over their North Atlantic Territories.
britain.48.a코0=Excellent!

britain.49.t코0=Denmark refuses!
britain.49.d코0=Denmark has foolishly refused our demands that we assume control over their North Atlantic Territories.
britain.49.a코0=It seems this will need to be done the hard way, then

britain.50.t코0=Reinhard Heydrich shot dead!
britain.50.d코0=On his daily commute, Reinhard Heydrich was attacked by British-support Czech assassins, who assaulted him with machine gun fire & a small bomb. Despite surviving the intial attack, only a few days later in Hospital he died of his injuries. Two villages were been razed in the search for the perpetrators, who were eventually tracked down to a church in Prague, where after a two-hour gunfight committed suicide.
britain.50.a코0=Someone will pay for this.

britain.51.t코0=Heydrich survives assassination attempt
britain.51.d코0=Reinhard Heydrich has been announced as  stable by the physicians at Bulovka Hospital, a week after an attempted assassination attempt by a group of ill-prepared assassins, who's guns jammed and had to resort to injuring the Protector with a bomb.
britain.51.a코0=Foolish Czechs, can't even shoot straight.

britain.52.t코0=Reinhard Heydrich killed in Prague!
britain.52.d코0=On his daily commute, Reinhard Heydrich was attacked by British-support Czech assassins, who assaulted him with machine gun fire & a small bomb. Despite surviving the intial attack, only a few days later in Hospital he died of his injuries. Two villages were been razed in the search for the perpetrators, who were eventually tracked down to a church in Prague, where after a two-hour gunfight committed suicide.
britain.52.a코0=What dangerous times we live in.

britain.53.t코0=Heydrich survives assassination attempt
britain.53.d코0=Reinhard Heydrich has been announced as  stable by the physicians at Bulovka Hospital, a week after an attempted assassination attempt by a group of ill-prepared assassins, who's guns jammed and had to resort to injuring the Protector with a bomb.
britain.53.a코0=It would have simply been too easy.

britain.54.t코0=Britain proposes peace
britain.54.d코0=British Prime Minister, Lord Halifax, a prewar supporter of appeasement and always a reasoned voice in the British government, has extended us an offer of peace, finally seeing the situation for what it is after the fall of France. Under the peace which we initially declared ourselves open to, Britain shall be permitted to keep her colonial Empire and simply withdraw from the conflicts on the continent.
britain.54.a코0=Finally, they have seen reason.
britain.54.b코0=I don't think so.

britain.55.t코0=British and Germans sign peace!
britain.55.d코0=British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden & his German counterpart, Joachim von Ribbentrop, met today in neutral Lisbon to sign an armistice paving the way for a full peace agreement, withdrawing Britain from the war in Europe and allowing her to maintain all her possessions. The French, Polish and other governments in exile have declared their dismay at this situation, and are predicted to relocate to America from London following the armistice.
britain.55.a코0=Europe is on it's own.

britain.56.t코0=Germans reject our offer!
britain.56.d코0=The Germans have refused our offer of peace, saying it is too late now for amends.
britain.56.a코0=The war will drag on, then.

britain.57.t코0=The British demand Northern Malaya!
britain.57.d코0=The British have sent a demand that we hand over nearly all of the western half of our country, our share of the northern Malay Peninsula.
britain.57.a코0=We do not have much choice.
britain.57.b코0=To hell with their demands!

britain.58.t코0=Siamese hand over Northern Malaya
britain.58.d코0=The Siamese have seen reason, and acceded to our demands in North Malaya.
britain.58.a코0=Excellent.

britain.59.t코0=Friendly British Foreign Policy
britain.59.d코0=The British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden today has presented a new Foreign Policy agenda, seemingly with the intention of courting, who else, but us? Talks are expected to commence between our representatives and theirs in Rome soon.

britain.60.t코0=Italians present African demands
britain.60.d코0=The Italians have put forward their interests in Africa towards us, and are in fact more managed than we would have initially expected.
britain.60.a코0=If a few backwater colonies are all it takes, then so be it.

britain.61.a코0=Excellent.

britain.62.a코0=Fools, they've lost a potentially crucial ally. We have no need of them.

britain.63.t코0=Italians present Balkan Agenda
britain.63.d코0=The Italians have presented their interests in the Balkans, primarily concerned with cementing Italian control over the Adriatic Sea. It is Dalmatia, promised to them in the last War, but instead given to Yugoslavia, that is at the centre of their demands.
britain.63.a코0=A narrow strip of the Yugoslav coast? That's all? Easy.
britain.63.b코0=We will not participate in the shakedown of an inconsequential Balkan state for it's coastline.

britain.64.t코0=British give their Approval
britain.64.d코0=We've just recieved the go-ahead from the British Ambassador having conferred with his government back in London. The British will support us on Yugoslavia.
britain.64.a코0=Excellent, now it's time to move.

britain.65.t코0=British reject our Agenda
britain.65.d코0=The British, neurotic and obsessive over their naval hegemony, have rejected our proposals for our interests in the Adriatic.
britain.65.a코0=Is this Balkan speck really so valuable to them?

britain.66.t코0=Britain & Italy present Demands
britain.66.d코0=Our worst fears have materialised - on the tails of recent talks and international closeness, we have been approached by British diplomats, who, on behalf of Italy, are requesting we cede our Adriatic coastline. The alternative, while going unmentioned as of now, is obvious.
britain.66.a코0=It is this, or a war we cannot win.
britain.66.b코0=Better to die on our feet than live as slaves.

britain.67.t코0=Yugoslavs agree!

britain.67.a코0=Excellent!

britain.68.t코0=Yugoslavs reject Demands
britain.68.d코0=The Yugoslavs, prideful and stubbon as ever, have refused our demands. They have chosen war.
britain.68.a코0=Their patriotism must outweigh their intelligence - let us prepare the battleships.

britain.69.t코0=Italy joins the Allies!
britain.69.d코0=Coming after the last few months of Italo-British Cooperation and a concerted effort by both countries to maintain peace, amicability and brotherly warmth in Europe, Italy has taken the final step by joining in Britain's alliance - an echo of the old Entente, as many say, much to German's dismay yet again.
britain.69.a코0=Bravo!

britain.70.t코0=Hostile British Foreign Policy
britain.70.d코0=The British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden today has presented a new Foreign Policy agenda, seemingly geared expressly against our Imperial ambitions, and promulgating a defence of the independence of all small Mediterranean states.
britain.70.a코0=We will have to watch these developments closely.

britain.71.t코0=The Peking Plan
britain.71.d코0=Organised in early 1939, the Peking Plan was an agreement in the case of a German invasion of Poland, that instead of fighting a surely lost battle against the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea, they should relocate to Britain and join our forces in aid of retaking their motherland. Those that have managed to make the ship have now arrived in London harbour.
britain.71.a코0=We'll put them to good use.

britain.72.t코0=Britain Reinforces the Far East
britain.72.d코0=Capping off several months of fortification and military development in th Far East, a dozen new divisions have arrived from across the Empire to garrison Hong Kong, Singapore and Rangoon. This is sure to ruffle Japanese feathers.
britain.72.a코0=An interesting move.

britain.73.t코0=Italy joins the Allies
britain.73.d코0=Coming after the last few months of Italo-British Cooperation and a concerted effort by both countries to maintain peace, amicability and brotherly warmth in Europe, Italy has taken the final step by joining in Britain's alliance - an echo of the old Entente, as many say, much to German's dismay yet again.
britain.73.a코0=Unexpected.

britain.74.t코0=Balkan States join the Allies
britain.74.d코0=In a clear move against Collectivist aggression in the Mediterranean and eastern Europe, Britain has welcomed Yugoslavia & Greece into the Allies, months after extensive projects supporting fortification & armament expansion in those countries.
britain.74.a코0=We do what we must.
britain.74.b코0=They have no business being there!
britain.74.c코0=What will come of this?

britain.75.t코0=Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act [GetYear]
britain.75.d코0=The Anglo-Irish Trade war has been a sordid affair raging from 1933, arising from Irish refusals to reimburse land annuities from financial loans granted to Irish tenant farmers. This breach of the 1921 Treaty lead to a breakdown in relations, and subsequent trade restrictions from both countries. But the last few months have seen a build-up of reconciliatory legislation, beginning with the Coal-Cattle pact three years ago, and now with this treaty declaring a formal end to the state of affairs.
britain.75.a코0=Huzzah!

britain.76.t코0=Imperial Conference [GetYear]
britain.76.d코0=The irregular Imperial Conference, last held in 1932, has been adjourned in London today. Provoked primarily by unfolding events on the continent, key issues were Foreign Affairs & Defence, leading to a debate on Dominion Foreign Policy in relation to that of the British Government, given New Zealand's strong feelings regarding the Italian Invasion of Abyssinia. One final, and rather major matters is that of the Imperial Federation - talk of the neccessity to federalise the Empire to counter the growing independence of the Dominions and the allegedly inevitable collapse of the Empire as a world power due to the growing power of the Soviet Union & United States has been going around in many circles since the turn of the century, but now it has achieved official attention.
britain.76.a코0=A preposterous suggestion, put it aside.
britain.76.b코0=Federation may very well be the only way to maintain Imperial unity.

britain.77.t코0=India submits to Federation
britain.77.d코0=Indian Representatives have now given their full backing in support of an Imperial Federation, and agree to join such a union when it comes about.

britain.82.t코0=Imperial Constitution Signed
britain.82.d코0=Representatives from across the Empire in Ottowa today after months of grueling negotiation, back-and-forth and debate have at last signed the Constitution of the Imperial Federation, bringing this years-long ambition to unite and federalise the British Empire as a single superstate into law. Many challenges lie ahead, and many issues remain in question, but the future is looking bright.
britain.82.a코0=This is a bold new step forward for the Empire, for Britain, and for the world.

britain.83.t코0=Mexico nationalizes their Oil!
britain.83.d코0=On March [GetYear], Mexico's government lead by authoritarian president Lázaro Cárdenas declared the nationalization of the country's oil resources, snapping up a facilities operated by Foreign oil companies, including our own Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. Since the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company itself was founded in Mexico, under Mexican laws we cannot intervene directly, however negotiation has at least resulted in the repayment of some debts left over from the Mexican Revolution.
britain.83.a코0=Who do they think they are?

britain.84.t코0=Irish Constitution of [GetYear]
britain.84.d코0=Ireland has declared a new Constitution, setting aside the old 'Irish Free State' moniker for simply Ireland, or Eire. No mention in this constitution is made to the British Commonwealth, of which Ireland is still technically a Dominion, and some readers find it to be of a distinctly territorial tone, in respect to Northern Ireland. The British Government has sent a clarifying communique reaffirming the position of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom.
britain.84.a코0=Worrying.

britain.85.t코0=José Luis Díez Incident
britain.85.d코0=A Republican Spanish Destroyer, the José Luis Díez, previously used to transport refugees, has been caught in the Strait of Gibraltar impersonating the British HMS Grenville, and using that cover to attack Nationalist shipping. Discovered and forced to harbour by the British Navy, she was secretly repaired by the Republican-sympathetic Gibraltarian working class, before being sent out again to repeat their ruse. It did not last long however, and the ship was again caught, purposefully beached and the crews repatriated to the Spanish Republicans.
britain.85.a코0=What a silly affair.

britain.86.t코0=Burmese Seperation from the Raj
britain.86.d코0=Burma Province has prospered under the administration of the Raj since the 1850s, but increasingly the Burmese have become restless, clamouring for self-rule and seperation from the Raj, still as a British subject.
britain.86.a코0=This seems about the right time.
britain.86.b코0=Let's hold off for now.

britain.87.t코0=Securement of Iran
britain.87.d코0=The Shah of Iran has been courting agents representing our enemies for too long.  The time has come to ensure that fascist influence does not propagate any further in the region and ruin our security in the Middle-East.  A new route for essential lend-lease material will also be opened to the Soviet Union after Iran is secured.  We must see if it is in our interest to involve the Soviets in this operation, and if they are willing to assist if we decide to operate with them.  The occupation zones will be pre-determined.
britain.87.a코0=Present extensive operational plans to the Soviets.
britain.87.a.tt코0=§LIran will be §Rfully§! occupied.  The Northern and Western portions of the country, including the port in Khuzestan, will be handed over to the Soviets, creating a corridor in order to properly secure Lend-Lease material.  The oil production in Khuzestan will fall under our control, along with the rest of the territory in the country.  Resistance is expected to be very high throughout the country upon the completion of this operation.  The occupation will be scheduled to end by all parties once hostilities have subsided.  Any economic interests that may have previously taken from us there will be restored (such as resource rights) after the occupation is finished.§! §O(Ahistorical scenario)§!
britain.87.b코0=Present essential operational plans to the Soviets.
britain.87.b.tt코0=§LIran will be §Bpartially§! occupied.  The Northern and Western portions of the country, including the port in Khuzestan, will be handed over to the Soviets, creating a corridor in order to properly secure Lend-Lease material.  The oil production in Khuzestan will fall under our control.  The region of Fars will be directly occupied by us.  Resistance will not be as drastic as opposed to full occupation of the country when the operation is completed.  The occupation will be scheduled to end by all parties once hostilities have subsided.  Any economic interests that may have previously taken from us there will be restored (such as resource rights) immediately upon the success of the operation.§! §C(Historical scenario)§!
britain.87.c코0=Conduct the operation ourselves.
britain.87.c.tt코0=§LIran's current regime will be forcibly replaced with a much more cooperative one in order to secure our interests in the region.  We will not directly occupy the country.  Any economic interests that may have previously taken from us there will be restored (such as resource rights).§! §O(Ahistorical scenario)§!

britain.88.t코0=Intervention in Iran
britain.88.d코0=The Shah of Iran has been courting agents representing our enemies for too long.  The time has come to ensure that collectivist influence does not propagate any further in the region and ruin our security in the Middle-East.  This will open a new front in the Middle-Eastern theatre against our enemies and create a larger buffer zone for the Raj.
britain.88.a코0=Begin operations.

britain.89.t코0=Cooperative occupation in Iran
britain.89.d코0=The Soviets have agreed to participate in the operation.
britain.89.a코0=Let's hope for a short operation.

britain.90.t코0=The Soviets refuse cooperative intervention
britain.90.d코0=The Soviets have refused to participate in the operation.
britain.90.a코0=Perhaps it is for the best.

britain.91.t코0=British Proposal for Intervention in Iran
britain.91.d코0=The British have approached us with a proposal to act against and fully occupy Iran for the rest of the duration of the war in what they call "Operation Countenance".  They seek to secure Iran to better facilitate lend-lease operations to the Soviet Union.  Their other motives are unclear; though securing Iran's oilfields seems evident enough to partially warrant their invasion.  This will surely allow us to fullfill our strategic goal of acquiring a warm-water naval base, however.  They have informed us that they will initiate the operation when both parties are ready.  How shall we respond?
britain.91.a코0=Let's oblige them.
britain.91.a.tt코0=§LIran will be divided evenly, with the North and West being occupied by us and the South being occupied by the British, with the Persian Gulf port in Khuzestan falling under our control and Tehran under British control.  This also means that Iran will not be able to be puppeted by us after the operation is complete.  Oil production will fall under British control in Khuzestan.§! \n§RImportant:§! We will be expected to withdraw from our occupation after the war.  We will anger the Allies if we don't.

How shall we respond?
britain.912.a코0=Let's oblige them.
britain.912.a.tt코0=§LIran will be divided into sections, with the North and West being occupied by us and Fars being occupied by the British, with the Persian Gulf port in Khuzestan falling under our control.  The rest of Iran will be administered by a friendly regime.  This also means that Iran will not be able to be puppeted by us after the operation is complete.  Oil production will fall under British control in Khuzestan.§!  §C(Historical Scenario)§!  \n§RImportant:§! We will be expected to withdraw from our occupation after the war.  We will anger the Allies if we don't.
britain.912.b코0=We have no interest in this.

Occupational zones are now being setup as previously agreed.
britain.93.a코0=Let's hope this pays off.

britain.932.t코0=Operation Countenance completed
britain.932.d코0=Iran's forces have been routed or have stood down by force.  The Shah's government has been denied an escape route and has been placed under surviellance.

A provisional government will be put into place that will be headed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the only current public figure able to fulfill the role.  Occupational zones are now being setup as previously agreed.
britain.932.a코0=Let's hope this pays off.

britain.94.t코0=Iranian Intervention successfull
britain.94.d코0=Iran's forces have been routed or have stood down by force.  The Shah's government has been denied an escape route and has been placed under surviellance.  Time will tell if he will change his stance and provide assistance for the Allied cause.  A provisional government will be put into place that will be headed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the only current public figure able to fulfill the role.  This arrangement will stand for as long as necessary.
britain.94.a코0=Let's hope this pays off.

britain.103.t코0=Iran Under Attack!  Operation Countenance now underway.
britain.103.d코0=British High Command has developped and initiated operational plans along with the [SOV.GetName] to conduct a full scale invasion of Iran due to the recent geo-political shifts in Europe, most notably in Eastern Europe.  Motives have not directly been made clear by either government as to why they have proceeded with the operation, but many experts speculate that it is to counter political and economic efforts of Germany and its allies in the region, and also to establish another logistics corridor with an added benefit of a secured border for both invading powers.  There is now doubt that the oil reserves were of high strategic importance in their considerations.  Opinions are mixed about prolonged occupation.
britain.103.a코0=The Middle-East is set ablaze once more.
britain.103.b코0=Iran should surrender...

britain.119.d코0=Our nationalist bretheren in Britain have reached out to us with a proposal.
