ray_gun_equipment_1_desc코0=The Ray Gun's appearance is of a generic '50s science-fiction film ray gun.The Ray Gun is a favorable weapon due to its one-hit kill strength (up to round 20-25 depending on game). It is sometimes disliked because of its splash damage therefore many players tend to buy PhD Flopper. Although it is less effective at long ranges (as the 'ray' moves slowly compared to other guns), it is pinpoint accurate. On both the Dead Ops Arcade maps, the Ray Gun does no splash damage to the player whatsoever.
thundergun_equipment_1_desc코0=The Thundergun is a large, cannon-shaped weapon that fires blasts of incredibly strong compressed air. It has no iron sights, meaning it must be fired from the hip (although when observed in third person, it is held on the shoulder). It is able to kill large numbers of zombies with a single shot, sending them flying backwards or up. Those who are not killed by the blast are thrown backwards and will remain on the ground for a few seconds before getting back up. The Thundergun holds two rounds in its magazine, and has 12 rounds in reserve. The Thundergun can only be reloaded when all shots have been fired.

This perk increases fire rate by approximately 30% in all weapons. It costs 2000 points to purchase.
RON_Element_115_desc코0=Divinium (more commonly known as Element 115), is very important in the Nazi Zombies Universe. It is the cause of the zombies and is also used to power the Teleporters, Ray Gun and Wunderwaffe DG-2. Group 935 tried to harness the powers of Element 115 to power their machines and create super-soldiers, which failed horribly and created the zombies. It seems to create a large amount of electricity, as seen by the Meteorite on Shi No Numa, which was used to help create and power the devices and weapons that Group 935 were creating.
RON_First_Aid_Kit_desc코0=Permanently restores health to player or teammates.
RON_Juggernog_desc코0=Juggernog is a Perk in Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops. It appears in every Nazi Zombies map (excluding Nacht der Untoten).

When purchased it will increase the player's health, allowing them to take more damage (four hits before red, the fifth being death).
RON_Monkey_Bombs_desc코0=When primed and thrown, it will explode in about nine seconds, killing some of the Zombies around it.

RON_Speed_Cola_desc코0=Speed Cola is one of the Perk-a-Cola machines in the Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops Nazi Zombies game mode. It is the Nazi Zombies variant of the multiplayer perk Sleight of Hand. Purchasing it will grant the player extra speed when performing certain actions such as reloading and rebuilding barriers. The barrier rebuild speed isn't really increased, because the pause time between barriers being rebuilt is the same because it will not rebuild until the player has been granted their points, so there is actually no difference.
RON_Teleporter_desc코0=The MDT (commonly known as Teleporter) is a device and in-game untility in Nazi Zombies. They were created in the experiments of Group 935 members Ludvig Maxis and Edward Richtofen. They appear in the maps Der Riese, Kino der Toten, 'Five', Dead Ops Arcade and Moon.
